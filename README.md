<h1>What is it?</h1>

This repository was created to include and archive various leetcode solutions I've made.

The structure of the repository will include a directory with the language I've programmed in and inside will be the scripts of the solutions.

<h1>How to use it</h1>

1. Clone the project locally.

2. Simply navigate to the desired language directory and select the desired script and execute it.

<h1>Please Note</h1>

Currently there are no additional requirements to run these scripts, should there be in the future, a requirements.txt file will be provided which can be used with the following command: "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the case of python.

Also, some scripts may include sections for executing it, but if the script you selected does not include this section, you may need to instance the Solution class and call the methods of the class so the script can work properly.

If you have any further questions or commentaries, don't hesitate to reach me at cfmoreno.github.io
